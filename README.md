# Dragon (Object Programming Language)

Dragon and DragonScript are a very high level 6th generation programming language that is inspired from ECMAScript 6 (JavaScript), Python3, and Ruby. Unlike JavaScript where everything is represented as a function. This computer language represents as objects and rules (in the form of functions) which govern how these objects behave in our environment. 

Dragon is compiled with a High Level Assembler (HLA). Its sister langauge, DragonScript, is one abstraction layer above Dragon. DragonScript utilizes a JIT (Just In Time) style interpretter; which is similiar to our compiler. The interpretter uses prebuilt binaries that Dragon compiles to.

Everything in dragon is considered an *Object*.
