Dragon is a high level 5th generation programming level that is based off from ECMAScript 6 (JavaScript), Python3, and Ruby. This typed computer language is compiled with a High Level Assembler (HLA). Its sister langauge, DragonScript, is one abstraction layer above Dragon. It can be run realtime with an interpretter, or transpiled into Dragon and compiled into executable binaries.

Everything in dragon is considered an *Object*.
